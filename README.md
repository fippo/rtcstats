##snoop.js
Low-level snooping on peerconnection API calls and periodic getStats calls

##Integration
Just one simple step: include snoop.js before any of your webrtc javascript. It will transparently modify the RTCPeerConnection objects and start sending data.

Integrating as a module is currently not supported.
